Create a script that prompts the user for a number. That number is to be used to display a simple message to the terminal X number of times (where X is the number captured from the user input). The message should include an indication of the number for each count the message is displayed.
#!/usr/ban/bash

read -p "Enter the number=" a
for (( b=1 ; b <=a ; b++ ))
  do 
  echo "$b" "Hello"
  done

output:
pratikshadikkar@SudhirD:~$ ./hello.sh
Enter the number=3
1 Hello
2 Hello
