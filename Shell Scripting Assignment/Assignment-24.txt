We are going to use nested functions to simulate the kind of abstraction you find in many object oriented languages. Create the following structures in your script:

a function that defines two local variables to hole the number of arms and legs that a human being has.
nested functions, one for each a male and female, that contain the appropriate number of beards that each gender has.
capture the gender as a command line parameter.
test the command line parameter and call the appropriate functions in order to display the characteristics of the indicated gender.

function gender(){
local arms=2
local legs=2
  if [[ $ans = Female ]];then
           Female;
   else
          Male;
    fi
   }

  function Female()
          {
          echo "Female has $arms arms ,$legs legs and no beards."
          }


  function Male()
          {
           echo "Male has $arms arms, $legs legs and beards."
          }


echo "Enter Male or Female" 
read ans
gender $ans

Output:
pratikshadikkar@SudhirD:~$ ./hello.sh
Enter Male or Female
Female
Female has 2 arms ,2 legs and no beards.
