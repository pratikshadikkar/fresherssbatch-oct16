Create a simple script that does the following:

Echo a full sentence to the terminal
Echo a different full sentence, but redirect it to /dev/null

Run and display the results and make sure the statements appear where intended.

 #! /bin/bash

#Script to print two different statements


echo "This is the full sentence"
echo "This is the full sentence going to dev/null" > /dev/null

output:
pratikshadikkar@SudhirD:~$ ./hello.sh
This is the full sentence
