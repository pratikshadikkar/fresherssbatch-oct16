Create a script that interacts with the user. Prompt them to guess a secret number between 1 and 5. Read the guess from the terminal and assign it to a variable. Using the 'if' statement from the course, test that value to determine if they guessed the right number (you choose the correct value). If they do, display a success message, otherwise do nothing.
#!/bin/bash

mynum=4

read -p "Guess a between 1 to 5:" gnum

if [[ $gnum == $mynum ]]
then
	echo "you guessed it right"

fi	

output:

pratikshadikkar@SudhirD:~$ ./hello.sh
Guess a between 1 to 5:4
you guessed it right
