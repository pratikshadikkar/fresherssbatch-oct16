Write a script that sets FOUR variables:

MYUSERNAME
MYPASSWORD
STARTOFSCRIPT
ENDOFSCRIPT

Populate the first two with some default value and use command redirection to set the third and fourth value to the date/time of when the script was started and completed. Within the script, be sure to display the values to the terminal when run.
#!/bin/bash

#Script to set variables

MYUSERNAME=PRATIKSHA
MYPASSWORD=12345
STARTOFSCRIPT=$(date)
ENDOFSCRIPT=$(date)


echo  "username:" $MYUSERNAME
echo "password:" $MYPASSWORD
echo "start-time:" $STARTOFSCRIPT
echo "end-time:" $ENDOFSCRIPT

output:
pratikshadikkar@SudhirD:~$ ./hello.sh
username: PRATIKSHA
password: 12345
start-time: Sun Apr 18 22:34:20 IST 2021
end-time: Sun Apr 18 22:34:20 IST 2021
