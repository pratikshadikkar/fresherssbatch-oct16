Create a simple script containing a single function. This function should display a message to clearly indicate it was generated when the function was run. Then, display another message outside the function clearly indicating it was generated outside of it.

#!user/bin/bash

function example()
 {
    echo "inside the function"
 }

example
echo "outside the function"

output:
pratikshadikkar@SudhirD:~$ ./hello.sh
inside the function
