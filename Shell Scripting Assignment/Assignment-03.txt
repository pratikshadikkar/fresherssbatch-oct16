Develop a script that creates, sets and displays two variables to the terminal when run. Within this script, add comments to explain what the script is doing, what each variable is and, using inline comments, what each command is doing.

#! /bin/bash

#Creates and displays two variable as output

Firstname=Pratiksha
Lastname=Dikkar

echo "Fname is " $Firstname
echo "Lname is " $Lastname

output:
pratikshadikkar@SudhirD:~$ ./hello.sh
Fname is  Pratiksha
Lname is  Dikkar
